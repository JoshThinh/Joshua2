    "## Reflection \n",
    "After listening to the Alumni talk about their own story and the things that they learned, I realize that there is a lot to learn about code and it takes extra time outside of this class and the homework to create a pathway for a career in the future. It's important for me to continue learning how to code outside the projects to increase my qualities to be more appealing for college apps and even in the workforce. I plan to apply to as many college apps to do computer science and I also want to apply for a computer science internship to advance my understanding on learning how computer science is used in the workforce. I want to attempt on making small projects and expand on those projects so that when applying for jobs I can display some of the things that I worked on. I also want to incorperate some skills outside of coding like becoming organized and having a plan so that I can be more effective when creating code."
