    "After listening to the Alumni talk about their own story and the things that they learned, I realize that there is a lot to learn about code and it takes extra time outside of this class and the homework to create a pathway for a career in the future. It's important for me to continue learning how to code outside the projects to increase my qualities to be more appealing for college apps and even in the workforce."
