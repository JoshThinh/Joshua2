- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with ability to operate Development Tools on it or within the Cloud.

- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Code in your blog.
- Slack Account, install the App on Laptop and/or phone, get used to reading announcements. Slack is the tool that we will use for messaging, we have been averaging 1000s of essages each year.
