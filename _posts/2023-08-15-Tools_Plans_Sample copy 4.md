### PBL Unit 1 / Week 7
This week was a bit different having to do my own team teach with my group. The start of the week we started to finish up our lesson. I also added some javascript within my code to add a cool feature to the game. During the teamteach we were required to give homework and grade it, I graded most of them. I added some finishing touches and then presented our website at the night at the museum.
