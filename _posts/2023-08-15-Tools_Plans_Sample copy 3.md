### PBL Unit 1 / Week 6
This week was similar to the previous weeks. I did come across a lot of errors during the process when trying to link a count to the frontend. This was difficult because I would need the backend but it was a long process that took too long. I took notes in class about the team teaches that week like iterations for python. In my website I added more functionality to the buttons with a better visual look.
