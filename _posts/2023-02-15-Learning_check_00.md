## Week 0
During this week I figured out the beginning of setting up the tools needed to code. I learnt a little bit about the different things needed to setup a webpage and code. I also learned about working as a team with a partner in csp and how beneficial it was to talk to other people outside mygroup to get their opinion on things.
